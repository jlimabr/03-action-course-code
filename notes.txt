Quick Note
While testing destroying an environment when a pull request is closed, I realized our workflow is not going to have access to our AWS role with the current trust policy. So for that we need to allow the pull request event in the destroy-pr-env workflow by adding this item to our array in the AWS trust policy:

"repo:github-actions-course/ci-cd-demo:pull_request:job_workflow_ref:github-actions-course/ci-cd-demo/.github/workflows/destroy-pr-env.yaml@refs/heads/main"

So our whole condition will look like so:

 "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
        "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "StringLike": {
        "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": [
            "repo:github-actions-course/ci-cd-demo:environment:staging:job_workflow_ref:github-actions-course/ci-cd-demo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml@*",
            "repo:github-actions-course/ci-cd-demo:environment:production:job_workflow_ref:github-actions-course/ci-cd-demo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml@*",
            "repo:github-actions-course/ci-cd-demo:ref:refs/heads/main:job_workflow_ref:github-actions-course/ci-cd-demo/.github/workflows/destroy-pr-env.yaml@refs/heads/main",
            "repo:github-actions-course/ci-cd-demo:pull_request:job_workflow_ref:github-actions-course/ci-cd-demo/.github/workflows/destroy-pr-env.yaml@refs/heads/main"
        ]
    }
}
